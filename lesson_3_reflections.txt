When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to use a remote repository for several reasons. You may be
    working on a project with another person, where you both share the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Let's say you and your teammate are working independently on separate files
    and your teammate pushes her commits to GitHub. If Git automatically stays
    up-to-date with your remote repository, the files on your local repository
    may be overwritten and you may lose all the work you have done.
